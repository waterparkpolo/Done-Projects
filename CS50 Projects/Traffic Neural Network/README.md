While building this traffic sign recognition model, I experimented with several strategies to structure the pipeline effectively. My first focus was ensuring that the image loading and preprocessing steps were clean and scalable, so I implemented a loop to iterate through labeled directories and resize every image to a consistent 30x30 dimension. This worked well because it kept the dataset uniform and avoided shape mismatches when feeding data into the neural network. I also tried different configurations for splitting the data. Additionally, I explored using TensorFlow’s Sequential API to incrementally build the CNN, testing different layer depths and neuron counts. The combination of two convolutional layers, pooling, and a dense fully connected layer seemed to perform the best while keeping the model from overfitting too early.

Not every approach went smoothly, and there were some valuable lessons along the way. Early on, I didn’t account for corrupted or unreadable images, which caused the code to break; adding a check to skip invalid files solved that issue. I also experimented with higher model complexity (extra convolutional layers and larger dense layers), but that caused longer training times with minimal accuracy gains, so I scaled back. Overall, the process taught me the importance of iterative testing: adding features one at a time, seeing how the model responded, and refining it into working version here.
