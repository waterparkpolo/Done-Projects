            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> What's the difference between a policy and a standard? [grc-policy-framework]</p>
            <p><strong>Response:</strong> A policy is a high-level statement of intent, while a standard provides specific, mandatory requirements to support that policy. This is a core concept of the [grc-policy-framework].</p>
